2
00:00:01,16 --> 00:00:02,66
accept a very pricey gift

3
00:00:02,66 --> 00:00:04,20
from the royal family of Qatar,

4
00:00:04,20 --> 00:00:06,60

that will be used as Air Force

One during his second term.

7
00:00:10,04 --> 00:00:12,54
The very lavish gift is raising

8
00:00:12,54 --> 00:00:14,91
substantial ethical and legal questions,

9
00:00:14,91 --> 00:00:15,84
and we want to talk about it

10
00:00:15,84 --> 00:00:16,51
now with Richard

11
00:00:16,51 --> 00:00:17,64

00:00:22,62 --> 00:00:22,92
Richard,

17
00:00:22,92 --> 00:00:23,69
thank you very much

00:00:23,69 --> 00:00:24,62
for being here with us

19
00:00:24,62 --> 00:00:26,69
and kind of walking us through,

20
00:00:26,69 --> 00:00:28,69
some questions around all of this.

21
00:00:28,69 --> 00:00:29,42
This is

22
00:00:29,42 --> 00:00:30,76
said to be the most expensive

23
00:00:30,76 --> 00:00:33,03
gift ever bestowed on a U.S. leader.

24
00:00:33,03 --> 00:00:36,03
It has a value of more than $400 million.

28
00:00:41,20 --> 00:00:42,74
Where do you come down in this?

29
00:00:42,74 --> 00:00:44,04
How would you assess this?

30
00:00:46,04 --> 00:00:47,07
This is legal,
