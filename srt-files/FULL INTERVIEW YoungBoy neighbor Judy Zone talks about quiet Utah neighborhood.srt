1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,79
so far. So, like these are my

2
00:00:02,43 --> 00:00:06,87
friends. And mind if I take some video

3
00:00:04,79 --> 00:00:08,80
of you? Sure. Hi. Okay. All right. These

4
00:00:06,87 --> 00:00:11,75
are your friends. Yeah, I know these.

5
00:00:08,80 --> 00:00:13,35
We've been to their house a lot. And

6
00:00:11,75 --> 00:00:15,92
then, you know, this is just a public

7
00:00:13,35 --> 00:00:19,27
access road. They the people who live

8
00:00:15,92 --> 00:00:21,75
here have to hire I know the guy who

9
00:00:19,27 --> 00:00:24,48
snowplows this road because the city

10
00:00:21,76 --> 00:00:27,11
doesn't plow it. Okay. So, that's part

11
00:00:24,48 --> 00:00:29,43
of it. And then, uh, you know, there's

12
00:00:27,11 --> 00:00:31,59
like five or six houses on this street.

13
00:00:29,43 --> 00:00:33,60
So basically, a lot of people in this

14
00:00:31,59 --> 00:00:35,52
neighborhood walk their dogs down the

15
00:00:33,60 --> 00:00:38,07
street because it's just flat and

16
00:00:35,52 --> 00:00:40,71
convenient. And if you walk in the cove,

17
00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:42,87
it's up and down, up and down. So most

18
00:00:40,71 --> 00:00:44,96
people like to just, you know, have a

19
00:00:42,87 --> 00:00:47,59
little stroll with their dog in the

20
00:00:44,96 --> 00:00:50,16
morning or the evening. And no one has

21
00:00:47,60 --> 00:00:53,67
ever said anything. And even So And so

22
00:00:50,15 --> 00:00:55,79
you were surprised by this on Saturday.

23
00:00:53,67 --> 00:00:58,32
Well, I was because I didn't know he was

24
00:00:55,79 --> 00:01:00,79
back, you know. I didn't know that

25
00:00:58,32 --> 00:01:03,67
Kentrella is back. So, I think I'm going

26
00:01:00,79 --> 00:01:05,92
to bake him some cookies and bring over

27
00:01:03,67 --> 00:01:07,28
there because we had such a nice chat

28
00:01:05,92 --> 00:01:10,64
after his daughter. He thought he was a

29
00:01:07,28 --> 00:01:12,71
nice guy. He's a very sweet kid. I mean,

30
00:01:10,64 --> 00:01:15,35
he's really young, you know. I mean,

31
00:01:12,71 --> 00:01:17,71
this is a very young person. Very, very

32
00:01:15,35 --> 00:01:20,31
young person. Very kind. He called me

33
00:01:17,71 --> 00:01:23,75
ma'am. I told him I've never listened to

34
00:01:20,31 --> 00:01:25,59
his music. He said I don't recommend it.

35
00:01:23,75 --> 00:01:28,07
That's what he said. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

36
00:01:25,59 --> 00:01:30,95
He's a man I don't recommend it. He has

37
00:01:28,07 --> 00:01:30,95
a southern accent. Why?
